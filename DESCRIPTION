Description: 
Time-Domain Heart Rate Variability Analysis is one way to analyze and interpret 
heart rate data. Time domain indicies quantify the amount of variance in the 
inter-beat-intervals (IBI). It is frequently used across different domains of 
research, such as medicine, human kinetcs, and psychology. Benefits of this method 
is that the cost of collecting this type of data is relatively low compared to other 
methods and statistical outputs can be compared across individuals.
